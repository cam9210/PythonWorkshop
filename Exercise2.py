#for/while loop problem
#Given a line of text as input, output the number of characters excluding spaces, periods, or commas.

#Ex: If the input is: Listen, Mr. Jones, calm down.
#the output is: 21

#Try this yourself! if you are stuck, the solution is commented on line 25
#to uncomment, highlight the code and press Ctrl + k + u (only works for visual studio code)
















# #Solution
# user_text = input()

# count = 0

# for i in user_text:
#     if(i != ' ' and i != '.' and i != ','):
#         count += 1
    
# print(count)
